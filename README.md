**Consistent  : Minimalist todo web app**


***Motto : One day, drops will make an ocean.*** 

---
Has 2 sections:
  -  Calender - calendar will show the reminders added in notepad. (60% screen occu)
  -  Notepad - This will be minimalist notepad. (40% screen occu)

Why this is minimalist :
  - We can add notes using using hyphen
  - We can add remoinders using @3jun OR @3Jun OR @3-6 
      - considers current year
  - // at the start of line marks tasks as done and removes the reminder from the calender.
  - Shows week view of calender

Why its safe : 
  - It stores all data to localstore.

Example :

- do the laundry
- make notes of API versionsing @3jun
- //- this notes will be ignored.
